 * to represent the root composition layer.
 *
 *
 * For example, if your content were arranged like this:
 * Gabriel (Shape Layer)
 * Body (Shape Group)
 * Left Hand (Shape)
 * Fill (Fill)
 * Transform (Transform)
 * ...
 * Brandon (Shape Layer)
 * Body (Shape Group)
 * Left Hand (Shape)
 * Fill (Fill)
 * Transform (Transform)
 * ...
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * You could:
 * Match Gabriel left hand fill:
 * new KeyPath("Gabriel", "Body", "Left Hand", "Fill");
 * Match Gabriel and Brandon's left hand fill:
 * new KeyPath("*", "Body", Left Hand", "Fill");
 * Match anything with the name Fill:
 * new KeyPath("**", "Fill");
 * Target the the root composition layer:
 * KeyPath.COMPOSITION
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * NOTE: Content that are part of merge paths or repeaters cannot currently be resolved with
 * a [KeyPath]. This may be fixed in the future.
